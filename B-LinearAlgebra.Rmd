#  Linear algebra   {#ch:algebra}

<b>Reading materials</b>:  STA108_LinearAlgebra_S20.pdf



## Vector

```{r}
  x = c(1,2,4,2.5,-1.7,1) # creates a vector (you can use "<-" instead of "=")

  length(x) # check the length of x
  class(x) # class of the object; you can also check typeof()
  ### Try z=list(); class(z);

  x[ 3 ] # extract one element in x..
  x[c(1,2,3)]
  x[2:4]

  z<-numeric(10)


  y = x^2
  ### Q: what is the length of y?
  length(y)

  ### The "default" operation in R is elementwise:
  x/y # elementwise division
  y-x*x # all elementwise..

  ### There are other operators..
  x %o% y # outer product of x and y

  x %*% y # Matrix product. Q: what is R doing here?

  sum(x*y)
```


## Matrix

```{r}

M = matrix(0,2,3) # matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns with all entries 0
# ?matrix


Xmat1 = matrix(x,2,3) # 2 x 3 matrix formed by elements of vector x,
### ordered in *column-wise* manner
Xmat2 = matrix(x,2,3,byrow=T) # ordered row-wise


M<- Xmat1;
dimnames(M)
rownames(M) = c("first","second")
colnames(M) = c("a","b","c")

dimnames(M)
typeof(dimnames(M))

### access elements through names of rows/columns
M[,"a"]
M[,1]

M[,c("a","c")]
M[,c(1,3)]

M %*% c(4,-3,1)  # multiply matrix M to vector c(4,-3,1)
M + c(1,-2) # add the column vector c(1,-2) to each column of M

M2 = cbind(M,c(4,5))  # create matrix M2 by appending column c(4,5) to M
### How to append row to M2?
new_row = c(1,3,5,7)
#?cbind
#?rbind

### What if we call length() on a matrix?
length(M)
dim(M)



### elementwise product of Xmat1 and Xmat2
Xmat1*Xmat2

### Matrix multiplication
Xmat1%*%Xmat2
dim(Xmat1)
dim(Xmat2)
Xmat1%*%t(Xmat2)


### Inverse of a marix
solve(Xmat1) # what does the error message say?


Xmat12=Xmat1%*%t(Xmat2);

Xmat12.inv=solve(Xmat12);

Xmat12.inv%*%Xmat12
Xmat12%*%Xmat12.inv



svd(Xmat1)  # singular value decomposition of Xmat1
### Q: what is the SVD?
### Try ?svd
        
```

## Other operations on vectors and matrices

```{r}
### How does R handle mathematically invalid operations?
### Example 1:
w = c(1:3)  # short-handed for c(1,2,3)
### Q: What is the length of w?

x + w  # no error displayed, but not quite a mathematically valid operation
### Q: what did R just do???
c(x[1:3]+w, x[4:6]+w)

### What if...
# Create a vector of length 4 (from 1 to 4)
n<-1:4;
x+n

### Example 2:

z = sin(x) + x^{1.5}* exp(-x^3)
### What is (-1.7)^{1.5}???
### How did R handle this?
x[5]
z[5]

### Defining sequences
3.1:8.9
# or use seq()
```

### Array

```{r}
### Arrays, a.k.a. tensors
### A matrix is a two-way array

?array # check for R documentation on array

A = array(rnorm(2*3*4),dim=c(2,3,4))  # creates an array with entries that are i.i.d. N(0,1)
?rnorm
dim(A) # checks the dimension of A

A[,1,] # returns the 2 x 4 matrix formed by restricting the second dimension index to 1

### What is the dimension of A[,1,]?

A[2,,] # returns the 3 x 4 matrix formed by restricting the first dimension index to 2

A[2,1,2]
A[A<0]
```
